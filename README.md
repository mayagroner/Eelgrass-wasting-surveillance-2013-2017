# Eelgrass-wasting-surveillance-2013-2017
Data associated with MEPS article 2021


1) Remotely sensed temperature data for seawater surface surrounding nine field sites in the San Juan Islands, WA, USA (9 files each names by study site) (described in manuscript). Site coordinates are also in manuscript. 

2) Results from 5 years of eelgrass wasting disease surveys at nine field sites in the San Juan Islands (methods described in manuscript). EWD prevalence was collected during all surveys. Eelgrass density was collected in 2013, and 2015-2017. Eelgrass severity was collected from 2015-2017.

3) Labyrinthula zosterae DNA concentrations for 28 eelgrass blades. Paired samples on each blade include 1 sample within a lesion and another sample on adjacent green tissue (see manuscript for more detail).
